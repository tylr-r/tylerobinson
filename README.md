# Tyler's Personal Site

This is my personal siteâ€”mostly a spot to share projects (like helix), my background, and ways to reach me.

## Features

- **Projects**: Things I've built, including the latest stuff
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Matches your system automatically
- **Responsive Design**: Looks good on all screens

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** + TypeScript
- **Vite** for speed
- **Firebase Hosting** for easy deployment

## Development

### Setup

You'll need Node.js (v18+) and npm or yarn.

### Run Locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Fire up the dev server:

```bash

```

4. Go to `http://localhost:5173`

## Useful Commands
